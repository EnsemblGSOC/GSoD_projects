# Ensembl manual: structure and style guide

## Brief explanation

Ensembl aims to release a new website in 2020 for exploring genomic data. With it, weâ€™d like to produce a regularly updated manual that is available alongside the website, describing the data available and how to access it. This project aims to identify the technologies needed for such a manual, produce a logical structure for the manual, and create a style guide.

Ensembl has vast amounts and types of genomic data with different methods to access it. The documentation should cover what the data is, where it comes from and how we process it, plus how to use the different tools to work with it. This needs to be organised into a logical structure to make it easily accessible for our users.

We release new software and data several times a year, so this manual would need to be dynamic. Writers need to be alerted when changes occur that need to be reflected in the documentation. Previous suggestions for this include using a ghost browser to take screenshots, then producing alerts when image analysis software indicates differences between old and new screenshots.

The documentation will be written by many individuals within and outside the Ensembl project, with varying technical ability. The structure will guide the writers to ensure they are writing relevant and complete documentation, while the style guide will ensure consistency of voice throughout the documentation.

## Expected results

* Identification of suitable technologies for storing, presenting and updating the documentation.
* A general structure listing the sections of the manual noting their approximate content.
* A style guide for the documentation, including how to use highlighting for different types of elements, diagram labelling and spelling.
* Sample documentation on topics that will be unchanged in the new website.

## Commitment
Full-time

## Mentors
* **Emily Perry** is in charge of the Ensembl Outreach team. Her team deal with things like help emails, training, online help and documentation etc -- anything that involves interacting with people who use Ensembl and helping them along. Her role in this project will be to help define the user's needs for documentation and also to explain the content where necessary.
* **Andrea Winterbottom** is the Ensembl web designer, in charge of designing the new website. Her role in this project will be in discussing the structure of the new website and its documentation needs, as well as thinking about templates and styles for documentation.
* **Andy Yates** is the Genomics Technology Infrastructure Group Leader, who oversees work involved in the Ensembl website and its presentation to the public. He will ensure any documentation meets our needs and expectations.
