# eHive manual update

## Brief explanation

eHive is a system to define and execute workflows. It operates by spawning autonomous workers which carry out parallel tasks in order to complete the larger pipeline. It was originally created for running in-house Ensembl workflows, but is now shipped separately and can be used to run any computational workflows. It is widely used in Ensembl and by other projects: we are aware of several hundreds active workflows, totalling thousands of CPU years on several compute clusters. eHive is written in Perl, with Python and Java plugins. It supports various job schedulers and has beta support for Docker clouds.

The existing eHive manual is hosted on Readthedocs, however there are improvements we wish to make to the documentation, including the addition of a cheat sheet. The overall goal is to make eHive more accessible: make the first steps easier for new users, whilst allowing users to reach intermediate and advanced levels quicker.

## Expected results

* Better documentation of advanced features.
* Cheat sheet.
* Other miscellaneous improvements to the existing documentation.
