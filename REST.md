# REST API documentation

## Brief explanation

The Ensembl REST APIs provide language-agnostic programmatic access to genomic data. The existing endpoints have been added piecemeal over time, and as such there exists redundancy of endpoints and inconsistency between the ways the endpoints have been implemented. We are in the process of auditing the endpoints to improve this, and would like to take the opportunity to improve our documentation with it.

The REST APIâ€™s documentation is split between an auto-generated description of our endpoints and a wiki user guide. Our auto-generated endpoint description uses an in-house custom system and is in need of updating and modernising. Our user guide was first written over 5 years ago and is due for review to ensure it continues to be informative and relevant to users. During this project, we would hope a prospective candidate would investigate alternatives to our in-house systems and begin to replace them alongside working with our engineers to produce an improved user guide/manual.

## Expected results

* Evaluation and selection of suitable technology for documenting the REST API endpoints
* Trialing selected technologies on a subset of endpoints and then rolling it out to other endpoints
* A new user guide/manual
