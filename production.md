# Ensembl production manual
## Brief explanation

The Ensembl teams have developed many automated pipelines to process and analyse genomics data. Those are used to produce the Ensembl databases, including our gene annotation, gene tree, regulatory build and variation annotation pipelines. Many people who work with species not included in Ensembl or with confidential data, would like to run our pipelines on their own data and produce their own Ensembl-like databases.

All of the code needed to run an Ensembl pipeline is Open Source, either from a public provider or written by us and distributed on GitHub. However, getting started with this involves setting up a complex production environment, and several pipelines require domain-specific knowledge.

## Expected results

* A manual detailing how to set up the production environment and run an Ensembl pipeline.
* A framework to host and document pipeline-specific information.
* A manual for each pipeline, written with the help and knowledge from the relevant teams
