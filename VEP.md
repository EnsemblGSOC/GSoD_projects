# VEP documentation

## Brief explanation

The Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) annotates lists of known and novel genetic variants with the genes they affect. This is available as an online tool, an offline package and REST API endpoints.

The offline package is the most flexible and powerful method of annotating variants. However, the many options are difficult to navigate, and the installation relies on a number of external packages which can be difficult to install.

We would like to rewrite our documentation to make it easier for people to navigate, and improve the installation documentation to include troubleshooting advice.

## Expected results

* Restructure of the VEP documentation.
* Installation troubleshooting guide.
